# Turner helium CCP validation target

AuroraPIC targets the four one-dimensional helium capacitively coupled plasma
(CCP) cases published by Turner et al., *Physics of Plasmas* 20, 013507
(2013), DOI
[10.1063/1.4775084](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4775084). These are
code-to-code physics benchmarks with quantified statistical agreement, not
experimental validation of a particular reactor.

## Published contract

The model is a 6.7 cm planar gap containing uniform 300 K helium. One
electrode is grounded and the other is driven by

```text
phi(t) = V*sin(2*pi*13.56e6*t),
```

so the applied voltage is zero at time zero. Electrons and singly charged
helium monomer ions are absorbed at both electrodes, with no secondary
emission. The initial electron temperature is 30,000 K and the initial ion
temperature is 300 K.

| Case | Neutral density (m^-3) | Voltage amplitude (V) | Initial plasma density (m^-3) | Cells | Particles/cell/species | Steps/RF period | RF periods |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | `9.64e20` | `450` | `2.56e14` | 128 | 512 | 400 | 1280 |
| 2 | `3.21e21` | `200` | `5.12e14` | 256 | 256 | 800 | 5120 |
| 3 | `9.64e21` | `150` | `5.12e14` | 512 | 128 | 1600 | 5120 |
| 4 | `3.21e22` | `120` | `3.84e14` | 512 | 64 | 3200 | 15360 |

The table uses the paper's cell count. AuroraPIC's 1D Dirichlet `nx` is the
number of endpoint-inclusive nodes, so the corresponding configurations use
`nx = cells + 1` (for example, `nx = 129` for Case 1).

The final 32 RF periods are averaged. The primary comparison is the
time-averaged ion-density profile, evaluated using the published mean,
standard-deviation, and chi-squared data. Useful secondary quantities include
mid-plane ion density and electron temperature, electron/ion power per area,
and electrode ion current.

For Case 1, the published chi-squared acceptance ranges are `55–303` at 95%
and `48–405` at 99%. Passing one stochastic realization is evidence of
statistical consistency, not a guarantee for arbitrary discharges; repeated
runs should leave those ranges at approximately their declared frequencies.

The prescribed collision set is Biagi 7.1 electron-He elastic momentum
transfer, two excitation channels, and ionization, all with isotropic
center-of-mass scattering. Ionization divides residual energy equally between
the primary and secondary electrons. He+-He scattering uses separate
isotropic and backward components. Intermediate cross sections are linearly
interpolated and values above the table range use the final tabulated value.

## AuroraPIC readiness

The first five bounded prerequisites are complete:

- 1D Dirichlet electrodes accept independent static offsets plus sinusoidal
  amplitude, frequency, and phase;
- the field solve applies the voltage at the new field time level;
- restart reconstructs the waveform phase from the stored simulation time;
- `scalars.csv` records the actual Dirichlet `phi_left` and `phi_right`;
- `examples/rf_electrode_1d.cfg` checks the zero, quarter-cycle, and
  half-cycle values with a bounded normalized 1D3V run;
- `velocity_dimensions = 3` retains transverse velocity through initialization,
  energy diagnostics, BGK, isotropic elastic/excitation MCC, and deterministic
  velocity-aware checkpoint/restart while preserving 1D1V as the default;
- `examples/mcc_relaxation.cfg` exercises the 1D3V MCC command-line path.
- named 1D collision models can target electrons and ions simultaneously with
  qualified diagnostics and a combined restart fingerprint;
- 1D3V ionization creates equal-weight electron/ion pairs, removes the
  configured threshold energy, preflights bounded storage, and defers newborn
  collisions until the next timestep;
- `examples/mcc_ionization_1d.cfg` exercises simultaneous electron/ion MCC,
  reactive products, diagnostics, capacity, and checkpoint integration.
- elastic tables can explicitly select projectile or center-of-mass lookup
  energy, and 1D3V supports separate finite-mass isotropic and exactly backward
  channels. For equal-mass He+-He, the backward channel exchanges projectile
  and neutral velocities while conserving momentum and energy. Both choices
  are restart-fingerprinted.

The configuration is:

```ini
boundary = dirichlet
phi_left = 0
phi_right = 0
phi_right_amplitude = 450
phi_right_frequency = 13.56e6
phi_right_phase = 0
```

In SI mode, voltage is in volts, frequency is in hertz, time is in seconds,
and phase is in radians. In normalized mode, frequency is cycles per
normalized time unit. A nonzero amplitude requires a positive frequency and
Dirichlet boundaries. Driven cases require `mode = transient`; the existing
instantaneous energy-window steady-state test is intentionally rejected until
cycle-averaged convergence is implemented.

## Blocking capabilities

AuroraPIC must not claim a Turner result until all of these are complete:

1. import and pin the exact benchmark collision tables with their permitted
   redistribution terms and provenance;
2. report species-resolved electrode current, deposited power, spatial
   density, ionization source, and phase/time averages;
3. implement statistically bounded campaign and chi-squared comparison
   tooling;
4. implement whole-RF-cycle convergence and phase/time averaging;
5. run the full case only through an explicit production profile. Case 1
   alone requires 512,000 steps at the published resolution, so it must never
   become an ordinary laptop/CI regression.

Open-access implementations such as the
[WarpX capacitive-discharge example](https://warpx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/examples/capacitive_discharge/README.html)
are useful independent integration references. LXCat is an open-access
platform, but access does not erase dataset-specific attribution, version,
or redistribution conditions. AuroraPIC's existing local import workflow
therefore remains the route for user-supplied data until an exact
redistributable benchmark package is identified and reviewed.

## Bounded execution ladder

Case 1 remains the smallest whole-discharge target, but shortening it changes
the statistical benchmark. Work therefore proceeds without relabeling a
reduced run as a pass:

1. **C0, collision-law verification:** exact center-of-mass energy lookup,
   finite-mass isotropic recoil, backward velocity exchange, electron
   equal-sharing ionization, and restart fingerprints. This stage is complete.
2. **C1, source and diagnostic lock:** acquire the electronic supplement
   outside the repository, pin its hashes and usage terms, normalize the exact
   tables without changing interpolation semantics, and implement the
   published density/power/current observables.
3. **C2, bounded startup screening:** run the exact Case 1 grid, timestep,
   particle weight, waveform, and collision model for a small declared number
   of RF periods. Check invariants, collision balance, sheath formation,
   restart, and resource behavior. This cannot use the steady-state
   chi-squared acceptance range.
4. **C3, checkpointed steady-state comparison:** continue only through
   explicit low-priority blocks, establish whole-cycle stationarity, average
   the final 32 periods, and apply the published chi-squared test.

This ladder gives useful bounded evidence early while preserving one honest
definition of a Turner benchmark pass.
